**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ Yes and no if you stick with a main party you still have to grind some. but if you switch characters to try them all and see how they effect the party you have to level them from zero and enemies dont take pity on you and you have to grind that much more

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ This game is a jrpg that makes fun of jrpgs and many many other games and consoles as a whole very interesting concept and design especially when there arent too many memorable jrpgs out lately.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes some of the mechanics are just as goofy as the characters and overall idea. (in one you have to lure two enemies near each other otherwise you wont be able to damage them and the quest has a striking reference/resemblence to pac-man

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ Most issues were player based, i moved to a spot i shouldnt or fought enemies that were too hard for me. Biggest issues is some of the quests again dont give you a direction or idea of how to solve them.
