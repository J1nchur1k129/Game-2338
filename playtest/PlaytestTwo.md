**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ 
The Game was literally straight forward for the most part to progress the missions you continue to the right in the levels and follow the map to enter each level. They explain the basicis in the first room you enter and as 6you level up they tell you your new combos on the screen.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ 
Honestly some of the items in the game were redundant or useless at times or at any given time sometimes you never use them again asides from the one puzzle or for secret items. (The boomerang doing literally almost nothing asides from stunning enemies)

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ 
Its both balanced and not balanced. The game does well in that by the time you reach the final boss you should be level 30 or so (perfect level to be fighting him) playing alone has less enemies playing with others adds more. But some levels are just abnormally difficult unless you chose a specific character (ie being the fire knight when in the flame area you do less damage) some enemies being absolutely absurd etc. The exp system works based on how many hits you do not how many enemies you kill so the best way to level up is to stay weak for forever doing as little damage as possible and as fast as possible.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ 
This game came out a few years agon on the xbox 360 was ported to steam later, recieved an update for steam and then xbox one and is soon coming to ps4 and Switch. I think for its time it was phenomenal as a goofy friendly game but as of late it wouldnt be a top seller.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ 
The game has a goofy medevil theme that has numerous gag jokes and dorky moments the combat is through magic and every day weapons youd see in the times and even some weirder ones like alien weapons and candy it is a very combo heavy game. 

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ 
Absolutely its been a while since i played it and it was just as fun and refreshing after all this time.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ 
I was able to cause a few glitches like magically jumping and shoving myself into places that i shouldnt belong. and also caused a glitch that let you phase out of cutscenes repeatedly (when kissing the princesses as a sandwhich powerup wears off youd glitch and be able to run away while she kissed empty air (very funny to see)
