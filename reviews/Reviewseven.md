### Rating
I rate games from 1- 100 this game at least what i played of it earned about a 5 
however most reviews for this game were beyond impressed and they very much enjoyed this game.

## Summary
The game begins in the world of Sylvarant, a land that is dying due to a steady loss of mana, an energy source that is needed both for magic and to support life itself. As crops begin to wither and hardship sets in, the people turn their hopes to the Chosen, a servant and messiah of the Goddess Martel, who can reverse the drain of the world by completing the Journey of World Regeneration. In order to regenerate the world, the Chosen must travel from continent to continent, awakening the Summon Spirits that sleep at ancient shrines known as "seals." While defeating the evil Desians (dont know what they did though to be honest)

You play as LLoyd a young man who is friends with the chosen. The chosen is the hero meant to return mana to the world and remove the desian threat and after recieving a vision from the oracle beigns their journey. we start right before the oracles vision and b eing our trouble maker main character immediately disobey a teacher and leave to go check on a flash of ligth that symbolized the oracle. After a quick tutorial they send you into the world. Upon getting to the shrine for the oracle we meet some "desians" (i say this because i think they were pretending) and are forced into a fight. Quickly a strong enemy shows up the heroes have no chance of beating until a mysterious figure comes and saves you. the chosen then is supposed to take on a challenge...

Combat in this game is weird. youre not told what to do at all asides from the targeting system which is weird because its 2d but upon switching targets changes to 3d andits all real time bvattle except for when youre in a menu to choose what moves youd like to add in asides from basic attacks. From this menu you can set up tactics for your team like defensive positions targeting and cast spells. However thew start oif this combast is unforgiving as theres no instantly known place to heal. one bad fight can cost you immediately if you dont have healing items on you. maybe this changes as you progress but right away the enmies hit pretty hard.

Even though this game is an rpg this game focuses heavily on the music for atmosphere and storytelling. Truthfully i thought this was a different game that actually involved music with the combat system so that is a mistake on my part hpowever pretty early into this game the sound track is fantastic and does not leave me feeling like there could be more and better. 

## Final Thoughts
I like thie story and concept for this game however a better tutorial that actually explained how to attack and what to do to like heal and etc /an  easier intro might be preffered. There were grammar errors and visual errors right off the bat like textboxes that stayed after the messages left
