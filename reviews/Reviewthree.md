# Game Review for SnipperClips

### SnipperClips
Cut It Out Together, a game for the nintendo switch.

### Rating
  This game is a solid eight out of ten the biggest thing holding it back being it deserves more puzzles.

## Summary
  This game is a cute little game where you play as two paper(?) like objects that when a button is pressed can cut the other, reform, undo the last action, jump, and rotate. wether you play solo or with another you have to control the two players to solve the puzzles. There is also a 4 player mode with more puzzles (able to be done by 2 players similar to how solo play is done)
  
  This game has three total worlds with 20 puzzles each (the first 10 are unlocked and by solving the first set unlocks the next 10. With the puzzles gradually getting harder and needing more precision as you venture farther on. While some puzzles hold a constant theme ( turning yourself into the necessary shape to match a design indicated by a dotted line) there are many puzzles like cut out a map, cutting out tunnels to let a princess go home, catching ballons and popping them and so much more. 
  
   While many of the puzzles are interesting they aren't impossible and have many ways to solve them each its a very friendly game very simple very cute but not the hardest game in the world. It also has a dlc that adds even more puzzles to solve that i actually havent gotten to play. This game while fun is not very long the best way to enjoy it is to come back and play it with others later on or to only play a few levels at a time until eventually you inevitably run out.
  
 
## Final Thoughts
  I like the game but overall i feel it could have been bigger though. Yes it has a dlc but i dont want to have to pay extra to gain more levels to feel like I got my moneys worth. This was one of the first games i bought on my nintendo switch and ive played it with friends and my girlfriend and all of the experiences are still fun and it has replay value after you've forgotten some of the puzzles. it just leaves you feeling like there should be more.
