### Rating
9/10 Very fun especially if you like grinding for items. 

## Summary
  Monster Hunter is a game where you play as a Hunter/Reasercher in a world full of large and otherwise fantasy creatures.
This game like the other entries in the series is about fighting large monsters ranging from lizards, large birds, wyverns, dragons, and even a Volcano(its's a dragon too) 
After beating these monsters you can use their parts to build armor sets with different skills and 14 different weapon options that all have different trees you can build and upgrade to under each monster
Each weapon is fundamentaly different and each have their own special quirks. Some are better at long range, others helping the party others are for pure straight damage.

  This series usually doesnt have too much story involved and is usually on portable systems, For the first time it's on household consoles and it actually has a decent story
It's a beautiful game and is so much smoother than the past titles. With this change though we had to accept that there's less monsters than previous games and thats because everythign had to basically be built from the ground up. 
They made this game very friendly to new players and actually disappointed some previous characters with how much your hand is held. However it doesnt take long for the game to show you its not going to go down without a fight and ramps up the difficulty later on. 

  The game focuses along the lines of reasearching monsters and when they become hostile or would cause danger taking them down.
Eventually without spoiling too much you meet monsters who are able to singlehandedly destroy or reshape an ecosystem. 
The combat is fluid and you can pull off some extraordinary things including mounting monsters leaping over them and even breaking peices of them.

  This game is meant to be enjoyed with other people but honestly I played as a solo player and didnt lose out on any of the enjoyment.
 You can join a hub of up to sixteen people and only four people are allowed per quest with the reward being split among you.
When you play with other people the quests difficulty is scaled to make it a fair fight. However this can cause trouble if you are up against a harder monster as dying three times toal between the party resultas in failing the quest.
Personally I enjoy mainly playing by myself or with friends but you'll rarely ever see me play with random players.
Every week they add in or cycle through special events which get you rare and sometimes crazy rewards!


## Final Thoughts
  I like this game immensely I love being able to take on dragons and other crazy and mysterious creatures and the armor sets are beautiful.
Its a very fun game that makes you work for what you want. Sometimes you wont recieve the rewards you want or sometimes random people can ruin a quest for you but overall it's a great experience.
One dissapointing thing that is being worked on though is the low amount of monsters, Theres plenty of past ones to add but its a combination of needing to update them to the new style and also adding new monsters to keep the game fresh.
Overall not that big of a problem and asides from those small complaints the game is great It's actually currently celebrating its birthday this week.
