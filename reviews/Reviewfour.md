## Summary

  Hollow Knight is a classically styled 2D action adventure across a vast interconnected world. Explore twisting caverns, ancient cities and deadly wastes; battle tainted creatures and befriend bizarre bugs; and solve ancient mysteries at the kingdom's heart.

  This game is an interesting yet simple game and although it doesnt give you too deep of a tutorial it doesnt need to give you any more than that. its got quick and easy combat focused mainly on dodging swingnging and jumping if youre quick you can maybe pull off a parry. this game is comparable to dark souls in the fact that if you die you have to find your dead body to regain your monetary inventory. the difference though is that youm have to kill your ghost/ phantom. until you do that youll have a broken energy bar that only fills about three fifths of the way limiting the amount you can heal yourself or use abilities at a time. This game has over 130 enemies that are all different and interesting.The more you fight them the more you learn about them after recieving a journal from a predator.
(side note do bugs have ghosts?)
  
  This game doesnt hand hold you it lets you explore and get lost and inevitably kill yourself. I went and explored most of the main area without finding the npc who gives you a map to write down if you travel all the way back up you can find shops in the starting town after meeting the respective npcs down in the cave systems who can either boost you in certain ways or can giv3e you a compasss for your map so you know where you are on it.You may get frustrated but when you finally pass an area it feels so good and fulfilling.
  
  As ive played for a couple hours i actually havent gotten too far? i dont really know how to measure my progress actually . There isnt a set defined path or a quest list that tells you how far you are or where to go most of the game is related to exploring and gaining new abilities and then back tracking. However i have beaten 2 "boss" type enemies i think in all ive MAYBE explored about 10% of the game and thats me being generous.

## Final Thoughts
this game is a cute/spooky delight and its absolutely fun i think if anything it could use just a small amount of progress bar or something to let you know youre not exploring somehwere thats inaccessable right now until you get new moves asides from that its great and while frustrating gives me a sense of "you did it" after passing hard challenges.
