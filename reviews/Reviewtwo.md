## Summary
 
  Polytopia is a small Indie game made by Midjiwan, a small indie studion in Stockholm, Sweden. They took an interesting approach and give you a free game on the appstore. 
 You can play against bots or locally for free but if you want to play online with friends they ask you make at least a one dollar purchase to support them and the online service.
The dollar purchase isnt just for online but it actually gets you a new tribe to play as asides from the original four so you now have a new way to play. The more tribes you buy the more players you can play against (bots or offline not sure about online yetas i only have two friends who also play.)

 This game is a cute little simple version of Sid Meyer's Civilization games.
If youve never played one the simple gist is you take control of a small tribe and slowly expand it until you take over the world.There are multiple tribes you can pick from and all of them have a different starting bonus but none are absolutely ahead of the other in any way.
To expand your tribe you must take one of the mutliple soldier units and inhabit a small tribe or destroy and take over an enemy city. Each turn you earn resources based on how many cities you other special buildings you have and the population of the cities.
Using those resources you gain every turn you can then purchase new units, or invest in technology to get a slight edge over the competition.

  Different technologies help you gain new bonuses like farming helps you gain population, fishing branches off into sea travel and navigation and everyone has the same basic skill tree SO by the end everyone should all be at around the same place unless they were starved for resources.
Only two of the twelve plus tribes you can pick from have slightly different trees but thats because they come with their own interesting mechanics.
These two tribes instead of the one dollar fee are actually two dollars. One of them is an aquatic people so you gain easier acces to oceans and new units.
My personal favorite tribe has the drawback of not being able to kill animals or cut down trees. which would normally hinder early resource grabs. However because of this they gain a skill to transform animals into stronger soldier units.
They also recieve a skill allowing them to place a totem of sorts to spawn animals every couple turns around forests that spawn or can be eventually built and having an animal around it earns you resources every turn.

## Final Thoughts
I like this game its very cute and lets me strategize to destroy my friends. It really brings out the warlord or peaceful adventurer in me. 
It has a few issues though it's very simple, i mean simple silly character models, it has very bad spawns sometimes
On the large map setting i got sandwiched in the western corner to the north blocked by one player and in the middle to south by another i was completely cut off from resources.
One of my friends was put on a five block plus shaped island with no resources to start and was ambushed by the bots who were given way advantageous resources.
Accidental decisions are final there is no confirm button if you clicked somehwere you might move a unit there on accident
and unintentinally block yourself from continuing this turn.
It's not a very original concept just like Hearthstone is a dumbed down Magic The Gathering, This game is a Dumbed down Civ game.
Its a very fun game especially to play with others or to try and speed run through especially for the price  of only a dollar. 
I enjoy this game immensely.
