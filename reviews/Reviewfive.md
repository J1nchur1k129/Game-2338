## Summary
  Terraria is a beautiful 2d pixel game it truly gives you a sense of a difficult adventure. it is a side scrolling game that allows you complete freedom there is a guide at your spawn who gives you a general idea of what you can do but from there the rest is up to you. as you dig and explore caves you can find more treasure and weapons build armor and keep upgrading on and on. There's plenty of weapons and cosmetic armor and plenty to do.
  
  Eventually once youre feeling tough you can take on the multitude of bosses ranging from king slimes, to a giant skull with arms to aliens to a wall of flesh queen bees and even aliens and moon gods. That plague the world and have multiple ways of being summoned or just spawning by chance. one of the special bosses the wall of flesh exists only at the bottom of the map in a laval filled layer that seems similatr to hell if you drop a voodoo doll into the lava the boss appears and chases you sideways. Upon defeating this boss you change the world. You enter hard mode and everything becomes even more determined to kill you when the game is already hard as it is. You spawn new biomes and metals and rarer mobs and some of the evil biomes spread eventually "destroying" your world. With all these new items you can now upgrade and craft and progress even further and continue to get more ridiculous set ups and fights.
  
   This game is interesting to explore and even after beating it coming back after a while feels great because you have no idea what to do again and its just as fun. Everything presents a new challenge there are so many different tools and items you can use and make they literally take some of the wildest ideas and put them into this sandbox game. You can be a pretty princess with a lightsaber riding a giant slime into battle you can be a pharoah in a ufo and best of all you can have multiple friends All on the server with you at one time. Items Stay on your character even if you travel to another world / map so you can take resources from another world and bring them in to help you continue. ever stuck bring in more things and keep on going!

## Final Thoughts
I like this game its alot of fun with friends and works great for people who dont have powerful pcs so ALL of my friends can play together at the same time everyones having fun but still struggling together. i love games that are difficult and have a grind but this game is sometimes too difficult because sometimes its a little hard to progress because some of the enemies hit so devastatingly hard. asides from that its fun and scary and gives that rush of adrenaline definitely enjoyable!
