### Rating
9/10 Very fun especially if you like grinding for items. 

## Summary
This game like the other entries in the series is about fighting large monsters ranging from lizards, large birds, wyverns, dragons, and even a Volcano(its's a dragon too) 
After beating these monsters you can use their parts to build armor sets with different skills and 14 different weapon options that all have different trees you can build and upgrade to under each monster
This series usually doesnt have too much story involved and is usually on portable systems, For the first time it's on household consoles and it actually has a decent story
It's a beautiful game and is so much smoother than the past titles.








## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
