# Game Review for Super Mario Odyssey

## Details

### Game Title
Super Mario Odyssey Only on Switch.

### Rating
this game was a solid 8/10 for me. 

## Summary
  This game is about the mushroom kingdom ... again. Bowser has Kidnapped Princess Peach yadda yadda we know how the song and dance goes. The Adventure begins! Mario loses to Bowser and he takes off ready to marry Peach. You wake up as Mario in a strange town of hat people and pretty soon one offers to help you because he also is trying to save his sister who happens to be Peaches wedding tiara. Useing this now powered up hat you can jump and reach places youd never be able to normally and you can throw him around to disable enemies or even transform into them and other creatures throughout the world.
  This game follows the same set up as Super Mario 64 , Mario Sunshine and, Mario Galaxy. You enter a place get stars/ shines/ starbits/ moons and proceed with getting more until you unlock the next place ! In this one though you dont have a specific order or limit to how many you can get before moving on, if you want you can stay in an area until you have grabbed them all or grab the required amount to fight the boss and progress to the next area. This game loves to reward explorers ! They give you moons and coins for getting into places you shouldnt, having that spirit of adventure.
  
  Overall the game is fun, funny, and full of Nostalgia. Certain secret sections of the game give you the old stars from N64 you can find the old castle from there too. You meet returning characters like Pauline the princess from Donkey Kong and most levels have some form of "flashback" that lets you play in the old super mario bros style for set periods. Theres multiple, costumes for mario some new some returning. its a huge leap and one of the main selling points for the switch asides from zelda and smash.
  
## Final Thoughts
I like this game it brought back alot of fun and memories something i didnt care for was that some moons were way too easy. and some theres no way of getting them unless you explore every nook and cranny of every map. and honestly after beating it i dont feel the need to go moon hunting and 100% the game and that makes me sad.
